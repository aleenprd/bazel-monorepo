<h1>Bazel Mono-repository for Learning/Teaching</h1>

I found that Bazel can be quite confusing to grasp from the documentation and the best way to learn is to try it out.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

In order to understand this repository and how to build it yourself, please refer to the numbered markdown files found in the `documentation/` folder. Consider them as your extensive README.md file.
